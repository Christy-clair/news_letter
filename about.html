          <h1>Types of Web Developers</h1>
          <p>
            There are a few types of developers. These developers build and maintain the website in certain areas. They include:</p>

          <p>1. Front End Web Developer</p>
          <p>
            A front end web developer is responsible for the client-side of the website. They design and implement the visuals and interactions that users experience when visiting the site. They work with the back end developers, who make those interactions possible.
          </p>

          <p>2. Back End Developer</p>
          <p>
            Back end developers are responsible for integrating what the front end developers do to the website. They work on the server-side and write website services and APIs.
          </p>

          <p>3. Full Stack Developer</p>
          <p>
            Full stack developers know front end development as well as back end. They are responsible for doing client-side work, which is creating mock pages to show how the website will look. They also know the server-side of things, so they can code and program features to make the website function properly. It is useful to be a full stack developer if you want to do all the designing, programming, and implementation yourself.
          </p>
